# Final_Project---Machine_Learning_Model

Problem Statement -
-----------------------------------
We do have a E-commerce dataset, we need to identify or predict who are all coming as visitors and converted as out customers.

Use the given data, there is a column called “has_converted” as target variable. Do the classification to find whether user will convert as a customer or not.

Steps to follow:
------------------------------
1. Data read
2. Do Multiple EDA with Plots (Show In streamlit)
3. Preprocessing
4. Stat Analysis
5. Feature Selection
6. Model Building – Build Atleast 3 models.
7. Do predictions for the Live stream Data.
8. Display the 3 model’s precision, recall, accuracy, f1-score

Modules-
------------------------------
1. EDA
2. IMAGE PROCESSING
3. NLP
4. RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
5. PREDICTION OF THE MACHINE LEARNING MODEL FOR THE GIVEN DATASET

Thank you!
